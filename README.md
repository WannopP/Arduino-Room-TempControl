# Arduino-Room-TempControl

  This is my first project for github haha...
  The project's idea to control temperature in storage room using Arduino hardware it will replace exising thermostat.
  
  This project just **initial idea** stage.

## Idea

  1. Customize Arduino hardware (4Duino-24, 4 points Thermistor, i.e.)
  2. Coding (May take some time, if i have time)
  3. Wiring
  4. Testing
